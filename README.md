# gpt_interface

A simple interface for using the GPT API.

## API Key

To use gpt_interface, you need an OpenAI API key (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).

I recommend creating a .env file and adding it to your .gitignore file. The file would contain the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-exampleKey
```

## Examples

See the examples/ folder to see how to use the interface.
